A fake [Pusher](http://pusher.com) server for development and testing.

It's intended to fully replace the Pusher service with a local version for testing, but can also be used for development purposes. It is not intended to be a replacement for production usage.

## Usage

### Test Environment

#### 1. Use the PusherFake JS for the Pusher JS instance.

```erb
<script>
  <% if defined?(PusherFake) %>
    // Test environment.
    //
    // Note: Ensure output is not HTML escaped, such as with the raw helper in Rails.
    var instance = <%= PusherFake.javascript %>;
  <% else %>
    // Other environments, such as production.
    var instance = new Pusher(...);
  <% end %>
</script>
```

#### 2. Start PusherFake in your environment.

##### RSpec

```ruby
require "pusher-fake/support/rspec"
```

##### Cucumber

```ruby
require "pusher-fake/support/cucumber"
```

##### Other

```ruby
require "pusher-fake/support/base"

# Reset the channels after each test:
PusherFake::Channel.reset
```

### Development Environment

In a Rails initializer, or any file executed during loading:

```ruby
require "pusher-fake/support/base"
```

If you're using Foreman or something similar you'll only want to run the fake for a single process:

```ruby
if ENV["PUSHER_FAKE"]
  require "pusher-fake/support/base"
end
```

```
web: PUSHER_FAKE=1 bundle exec unicorn ...
worker: bundle exec ...
```

## Examples

* [pusher-fake-example](https://github.com/tristandunn/pusher-fake-example) - An example of using pusher-fake with Cucumber to test a Rails application.

## Goal

Fully recreate the Pusher API service for development and testing.

#### Why?

* Using a remote API for testing is slow.
* Working offline is currently impossible.
* Wasting connections and messages in development is unreasonable.
* Stubbing the JavaScript, such as with [pusher-test-stub](https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-test-stub), is suboptimal and tedious for integration tests.
